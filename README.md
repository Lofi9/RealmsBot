# RealmsBot
RealmsBot is a bot in development for "The Realms We Tread" discord server.
Permanent invite link: https://discord.gg/6YYcjfn9aj

We like to call her "Ribbit", as often in nature she is jumpy and cautious like a frog.
"Ribbit is a name that suggests you give up what you want so other people can have what they need."

The perfect name for our favourite Cosmic Butler.

when cloning the repo you must make your own .env file for the bot to read
